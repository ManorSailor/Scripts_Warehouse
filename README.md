## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository contains bunch of scripts which are either *Useless* *CopyCats* *WIPs*.
Consider this repo serves as my origin in the scripting world. Currently, nothing much to show-off here but, I believe that will change in the not so distant future.
Care to Star it? :)

## Getting Started <a name = "start"></a>

One notable thing to keep in mind is that, all of these scripts are/were (being) written on [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux).
So they will **NOT** work on any Linux distribution because of different hierarchy structure.

Please have a look [Here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux)

**Make sure to run these scripts only on Termux!**

## Dependencies <a name = "depends"></a>
**pkg install -y pkgname**

* git
* tput
* ncurses-utils
* binutils
* coreutils
* sensible-utils
* curl/wget

## Installing <a name = "install"></a>

First, Clone the rep, then just execute the `setup script` in the root directory of the repo. It will take care of everything.

In the future, this may change.
