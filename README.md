# 				Introduction

I guess you already know what Termux is, i mean that's why you are here :P. Just in case you didn't know.
"Termux is an amazing app created by @fornwall aka Fredrik Fornwall.
It can be used as a basic terminal or can be turned into a full blown linux environment using packages."

This repo is going to hold all the scripts which are going to modify the behaviour of termux to reap some greater functionality i.e., not provided by default.

Dependencies:
Tput
ncurses-util

**Readme will be updated as the need arises**
